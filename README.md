## Introduction ## 
People everywhere find themselves unaware of the amount of calories they consume a day.
This is not surpising due to the amount of stresses and daily tasks that demand our constant attention. From work, to taking care of  kids, to performing well in college classes, Americans are overwhelmed with busy schedules. 
This has lead to a loss of personal focus in regards to consumption of a moderate daily intake of food in American culture. 
So how does this affect American people? 
According to [ National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease ]( https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity), America is facing an obesity epidemic. Upon this concerning fact, we will take a look at how a healthcare professional can perform a 24 hour food recall in order to improve nutritional status of Americans.


In order to develop a beneficial change in American's food consumption, an evaluation of an individual's diet must take place. 
A 24 hour food recall requires a very in-depth and brain stretching task for individuals involved. 
The client must be able to recall all the food that they have consumed in the last 24 hours. 
This allows a dietitian or any health conscious individual to be able to advise, encourage, and ultimately provide resources for the patient to become a healthier and version of themselves.
A step-by-step guide is needed in order to complete the recall without forgetting important things that a healthcare provier will need for the later parts of an assessment. 
The following provides step-by-step instructions for a healthcare professional on how to construct a 24 hour diet recall in order to advance in determining nutritional needs later in the future. 

## Get Prepared ##
When performing a 24 hour dietary recall, you must be prepared in order to achieve your goal. Make sure you have (a):
>Pen

>24 Hour Food Recall Chart (Includes spaces for breakfast, a.m. snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, p.m. snack)

>Calculator

>20-30 minutes

>Friendly attitude


## Step 1 ##
The first step in a 24 hour dietary recall is the most important thing in order to get the most accurate data from an individual. 
Begin by giving a proper introduction of oneself in order to provide a comfortable and welcoming experience. 
Next, let the client know that they are in a safe and judgement free zone to talk about their food consumption. 
Often times people feel as though they will be judged based on the foods they consume; therefore, they choose to withhold information about the food choices that they make.
This fear of judgement can disrupt the accuracy and goal of the 24 hour recall. 
You must keep in mind that this recall is not about making someone feel bad about what they consume, but rather how you can help them. 
To begin the food recall, ask the client to be as accurate and honest as possible.

## Step 2 ##
Since breakfast is typically the first meal of the day, begin by asking for a breakfast recall. 
Here we want to know information such as what food was eaten, how much was eaten, how it was prepared, and how it was served.

Doing this includes the following questions:

>What time did you eat your first item of food today? (Record in chart) 

>What did you eat? (Record in chart)

>How much did you consume? (Record in chart) 

>How was it cooked or served? Warm or cold? (Record in Chart)

>What beverages did you consume? How much? (Record in chart)

>Do you take any medications, supplements, or vitamins? (Record in chart)

After each question is asked and answered, record information in an organized 24 Hour Food Recall Chart. 

*If no food was consumed in the morning hours, record this in chart. Record all data and information given* 

**Note**

It is very important to not rush this process. Recalling information may take time and patience. 

## Step 3 ##
Next is the recall of a morning snack. Just like in the previous step, the type of food, time consumed, beverages consumed, and supplements is asked and recorded. If no morning snack is consumed, move on. 

**Note** 

Make sure portion sizes are accurate by giving visual aids to ensure the individual is able to properly estimate intake.

## Steps 4-6 ##
Steps 4-6 are very similar to steps 2 and 3.
Continue on with the dietary recall for lunch, afternoon snack, and dinner. Make sure and include beverages and supplements.

Always remember to ask about added dressings, dips, etc. Those add up quickly and must not be forgotten in a dietary recall.
If an individual states they consumed a salad for lunch, make sure and include questions such as:

>Did you use dressing on top? If so, how much and what kind?

>What extra's were added? (Crutons, nuts, bacon, etc.)

Remember to go slow and be as thorough as possible. This results in more accurate recall. 

## Step 7 ##
To conclude a dietary recall of a client, a final recall of any pm snacks is taken place. 
At this time, you will read back to the client their 24 hour recall and ask if there is anything missing or inaccurate. 
Additions can be made at this point.

# FAQ #
## What if an individual is unable to recall? ##

This is a very common issue concerning dietary recalls. Many times individuals are unaware of what they are eating from day to day. 
Upon this issue, there are two options:

>1. Ask the individual to try their best to recall a normal day. Even if they are unable to remember that specific day, they often times are able to identify a normal days diet or patterns in their day to day meals. 

>2. Ask the individual to reschedule a meeting the following week. During this time in between, they must record their food intake in a journal to be shared at the next meeting. 

## What if they are recalling in the middle of the day? 

If a dietary recall is done in the middle of the day, have no fear!
Ask the individual to begin with their most recent consumption of food and progress backwards. 

For example, 

>Johnny has been asked to do a 24 hour recall. However, it is 3 in the afternoon and he has not ate his dinner or his usual bowl of ice cream as a late night snack. So should he make it up or pretend like he has already done it? Wrong. Instead, Johnny will begin by recalling his most recent food intake, followed by lunch, then breakfast. He then will recall his previous nights pm snack as well as dinner.Just because those meals happened during different days, they are still within 24 hours of each other, thus can be recorded with no issues.

## What is the point of a 24 Hour dietary recall?

A dietary recall allows a professional healthcare provider such as a dietitian or a doctor be able to identify issues in consumption that can be causing health problems.
Although seemly simple, a dietary recall must be done with precise detail and accuracy. 
If not taken seriously or without proper guidelines, the information will be inaccurate and of no use. 

## What happens after a dietary recall? ##
After recalling a client's past 24 hour diet intake, an advising session takes place. Calculations of total caloric intake, macronutrient intake, and overall examination of a well balanced intake are done. 
Plans are formulated to improve diet, reduce calories (if needed), and recommendations are given.

# Conclusion #
Performing a 24 dietary recall is not as simple as one may believe. 
Upon following the steps provided, one should be able to assess an individual's intakes without error. 
This is very important in improving overall health in America and raise awareness to individuals on the amount of calories and nutrients needed vs consumed.
